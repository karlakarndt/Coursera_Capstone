    "# Capstone Project -- Where should we retire?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction/Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though retirement may be far into the future for many taking this class, it is not for some of us. In fact, it's right around the corner! In addition, I belong to an organization that helps seniors plan for these big decisions so know a lot of people that need help in their retirement location planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many factors that affect when to retire such as financial and health. But, \"where to live\" is also a major decision.  Many choose to live their retirement years from their current residence. Some may become snow birds and live a few weeks or months in a warmer climate while others may travel to foreign destinations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Where to call 'home base'\" is the focus of this project. For those who desire to relocate from the city they've called \"home\" for many years, the decision can be daunting. Even cities that seem similar on the surface can lead to different lifestyles and entertainment opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project could be generalized to allow for other seniors to plan for their optimal retirement location, but for this project, I want to keep it personal to make it more realistic.  That is, I'm going to focus on my husband's and my hobbies and desires for a retirement location. We know we want to retire in Wisconsin, but we don't know where.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to find some specifics to help us make our decision such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fishing. There is a lot of available fishing, but we want to be able to fish for walleye. We also have a boat and need access to a public boat ramp.\n",
    "\n",
    "- State parks. We hike and camp a lot. I want to explore state parks in my retirement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, some of the information above many not be readily available. I will discover in the next part of the assignment on data if I can accomplish the above. If I cannot, I will choose to delve into other types of activities such as restaurants and shopping districts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other criteria we are considering at this time:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Location close to family. We would like to be within 2 hours of Germantown, Wisconsin.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The city we ultimately chose to call \"home\" during our retirement needs to have good Italian restaurants. I have Celiac disease and Italian restaurants are generally very accomodating. \n"

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding data to manipulate is the key. I want to be able to merge the data so that I have one map with all of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fishing: I found a fish map by type of fish on the DNR website. I was able to download the information I needed into a csv file and I stored it in github. The data included the lakes' latitude and longitude and if it had a boat landing. Basically, it had everything I needed right in one file!\n",
    "    - https://dnr.wi.gov/lakes/lakepages/Results.aspx?page=walleye\n",
    "    - walleye.csv -- The file on github that I created from the link above.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The columns in the table are as follows:\n",
    "      - 'Waterbody ID Code (WBIC)' \n",
    "      - 'Lake Name' \n",
    "      - 'Size (Acres)'\n",
    "      - 'Official Max Depth'\n",
    "      - 'Official Mean Depth'\n",
    "      - 'Latitude'\n",
    "      - 'Longitude'\n",

    "      - 'Water Clarity'\n",
    "      - 'County'\n",
    "\n",
    "    The columns I am interested in are the following:\n",
    "      - Lake Name -- The name of the lake\n",
    "      - Size (Acres) -- We don't want to fish on anything less than 10 acres\n",
    "      - Official Max Depth -- We don't want to fish on anything that has a maximum depth of less than 10 feet\n",
    "      - Latitude -- The latitude\n",
    "      - Longitude -- The longitude\n",
    "      - Public Landing -- The value must be 'Yes'\n",
    "      - Fish Present -- This isn't necessary. It may seem necessary, but the data was already gathered for lakes that have walleye; therefore, it's redundant.\n",
    "  \n",
    "     I will build a dataframe with the fields listed above from the csv file using pd.read_csv.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Using that dataframe, I will produce a folium map of all the lakes that meet the criteria.\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "State parks:  The wiki page below lists the state parks in Wisconsin.\n",
    "    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wisconsin_state_parks\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - State park name:\n",
    "            - I will be able to scrape the names of all the Wisconsin state parks from this page using BeautifulSoup. There's no other information on the page that I can use.   \n",
    "            - I'll have to clean the data a bit because it lists more than just state parks such as recreation areas. We are not interested in those.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - After I get the names of the state parks from this page, I'll use geopy.geocoders Nominatim to get the latitude and longitude of the state parks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Using a dataframe with the park names, latitudes, and longitudes, I will generate a map of all the state parks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Combining the data:  The goal of this part of the project is to combine the two maps so that I can see where there are walleye lakes that are close to state parks so that we can camp and fish. The lake doesn't need to be in the state parks. We just want them close enough for convenience. I then want to find a city or two that are reasonably close (within a couple hours) to that location and also within a couple hours of Germantown (see more information below). \n",
    "\n",
    "Foursquare:  Finally, once we can peruse the maps of state parks and walleye lakes, we want to find a community to call home that is within 2 hours of Germantown, Wisconsin, that has Italian restaurants. I have Celiac disease and Italian restaurants are usually gluten-free friendly. I will use Foursquare data to find the venues as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Find Italian restaurants in the city of choice: Do a Foursquare search using the latitude and longitude of the city of choice.\n",
    "    - Create a map around the city of the Italian restaurants.\n",
    "    - Choose some Italian restaurants.\n",
    "    - Get the restaurant ratings using Foursquare.\n",
    "    - Display the tips using Foursquare. Maybe even somebody said they have gluten free food!\n",
